"A beginner Machine Learning project to predict student scores using Linear Regression"
 Student Score Prediction

This is my **first Machine Learning project**.  
Using **Linear Regression**, the model predicts a student's exam score based on the number of study hours.

# Features
- Data visualization (Hours vs. Scores)
- Linear Regression model training
- Model evaluation (MAE, MSE, RÂ² Score)
- User input for prediction
- Streamlit app for interactive UI

# Example Prediction
If a student studies **7.5 hours/day**, the model predicts a score of ~92.
